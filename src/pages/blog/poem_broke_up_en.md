# Okay here is my first english poem


My heart is panting<br/>
Your manners requiring<br/>
With blade of your spirit torn apart<br/>
Almost in two but healing<br/>
Nevertheless still hurt and squealing<br/>
Our relation was tart<br/>
I must tell you, you have not been fair.<br/>
But what I do not say<br/>
that because of you, our relationship was a fail<br/>



Hope it is english correct in some way, because I showed it to my english friend and he had different
opinion but when he has finished with it, it didn't felt like mine so I implemented just some of his ideas.
