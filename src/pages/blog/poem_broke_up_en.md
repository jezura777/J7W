# Okay here is my first english poem


My heart is panting
Your manners requiring
With blade of your spirit torn apart
Almost in two but healing
Nevertheless still hurt and squealing
Our relation was tart
I must tell you, you have not been fair.
But what I do not say
that because of you, our relationship was a fail


Hope it is english correct in some way, because I showed it to my english friend and he had different
opinion but when he has finished with it, it didn't felt like mine so I implemented just some of his ideas.


        Nice day Jezura7777.
